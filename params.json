(A similar system has been used in production to\r\napproximately 500 real servers across distributed networks.)\r\n\r\nIt also adds each user to that server's *sudoers* (by default - you can just\r\ncomment that line out).\r\n\r\nIt's a very simple script - read through it and it will probably be very simple\r\nto customize.\r\n\r\nThere's a built in demo -- running the cloudadmins script will automatically\r\ncreate this README, create some sample directories and run a demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Create a hostgroup in hostgroups/ with a single hostname on each line.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Create a user directory with the directory's name\r\n    as the user's username in the users/ directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Copy the user's public key as users/username/id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Symlink the previously-created hostgroup into that user's directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike my Userify product, there is a real upwardly-scalable limit on how high\r\nthis can scale due to the push model but this is a very simple solution that\r\ncan go pretty far.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Notes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis script requires bash. Please do not do fancy shell script shortcuts like wget -O- $url | bash as they'll mess up xargs.\r\nJust download it into /tmp somewhere, make executable, and run it properly and nobody will get hurt. :) Also, this of course\r\nrequires the use of SSH keys, and cannot work with SSH passwords. Shameless plug: for a proper enterprise solution,\r\nsee http://userify.com/.\r\n\r\nExample installation/test:\r\n    cd /tmp/; mkdir test; cd test; wget https://raw.github.com/jamiesonbecker/cloudadmins/master/cloudadmins.sh; chmod +x cloudadmins.sh; ./cloudadmins.sh\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\n\r\n    Walking Users..\r\n    Walking Hostgroups for user1..\r\n    Walking Hostgroups for user2..\r\n    Walking Hosts for hostgroupY..\r\n    Walking Hosts for hostgroupX..\r\n    Walking Hosts for hostgroupX..\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-a\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user2/hostX-a\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-f\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-b\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostY-e\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostY-g\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostY-d\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostY-a\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-d\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-e\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostY-f\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user2/hostX-g\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user2/hostX-c\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-c\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user2/hostX-e\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user2/hostX-b\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostY-b\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-g\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user2/hostX-d\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user1/hostY-c\r\n    error; please see ./errors/adduser/user2/hostX-f\r\n\r\nAs we would expect, the fake hostnames give us an error, but they're just there as an example of how to run the example:\r\n\r\n    $ cat ./errors/adduser/user1/hostX-a\r\n    ssh: Could not resolve hostname hostX-a: Name or service not known\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown bugs/limitations\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  No option to remove or perform other operations on a user. (userdel -r username)\r\n\r\n2.  \"Push\" model not very scalable (see userify.com for a far more powerful solution with an open agent.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\n*   Userify: [http://userify.com]\r\n\r\n*   Twitter: [http://twitter.com/JamiesonBecker]\r\n\r\n*   Author Homepage: [http://jamiesonbecker.com]\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jamieson Becker <jamieson@jamiesonbecker.com>\r\n\r\nFree Software released under the GPL version 2 or later (at your option)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
